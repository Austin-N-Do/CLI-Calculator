(Originally completed earlier, now published here for reference.)

 - live demo: https://austin-n-do.github.io/CLI-Calculator/
- for later Application Modernization
Updates
1. C++ API Integration
The calculator now supports using a C++ backend via an API instead of relying solely on JavaScript evaluation.
Requests from the frontend are sent to the server, which calls the C++ code to compute results.
This improves performance and enables future support for more complex operations.
### New Features
- **Exponentiation (`^`)**: Supported.
- **Parentheses (`()`)**: Logic in progress;

Parentheses are not yet supported but will be implemented in a future update.
### Roadmap
- [x] Command-line calculator (C++)
- [x] fixed exponents - failing
- [ ] Parenthesis 
- [ ] Web app version (in progress)
